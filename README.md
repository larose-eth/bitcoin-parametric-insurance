# bitcoin-parametric-insurance

A decentralized insurance platform that automatically pays out based on verifiable real-world events, backed by Bitcoin liquidity pools.

## Overview

This protocol enables parametric insurance policies that execute automatically when predefined conditions are met, without requiring manual claims processing. Unlike traditional insurance that compensates for actual losses after they occur, parametric insurance pays out when trigger events happen, regardless of the actual loss amount.

## Key Features

- **Smart Contracts with Automated Payouts**: Trigger payouts automatically based on oracle-verified data for:
  - Weather events (rainfall, temperature, wind speed)
  - Flight delays and cancellations
  - Crop yields and agricultural metrics
  
- **Bitcoin-Backed Liquidity Pools**: Insurance reserves backed by Bitcoin, providing security and transparency

- **Risk Assessment Algorithms**: Utilize historical data to accurately price risk and determine appropriate premiums

- **Clarity-Powered Risk Models**: Premium calculations based on sophisticated risk models implemented in Clarity

- **Partial Claim Settlements**: Proportional payouts based on event severity and predefined thresholds

- **L2 Integration**: Compatibility with Bitcoin L2 solutions for faster, more efficient payouts

## Architecture

The protocol consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Policy Management Contracts**: Handle policy creation, premium payments, and policy terms
2. **Oracle Integration Contracts**: Connect to external data sources for event verification
3. **Payout Execution Contracts**: Determine and execute appropriate payouts
4. **Liquidity Pool Contracts**: Manage insurance reserves and capital efficiency
5. **Risk Assessment Contracts**: Calculate premiums based on risk models

## Implementation Roadmap

The protocol is being developed incrementally, with each component carefully designed and tested:

- Phase 1: Weather-based parametric insurance contracts
- Phase 2: Flight delay insurance implementation
- Phase 3: Agricultural yield insurance contracts
- Phase 4: Bitcoin liquidity pool integration
- Phase 5: Advanced risk modeling and premium calculation
- Phase 6: L2 integration for improved scalability

## Development

This project is built using Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain, which provides Bitcoin-based security and finality.
